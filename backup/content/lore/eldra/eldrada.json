They are godlike, neigh-omnipotent beings who possess supreme control over the aspect which they preside. They are worshiped by Mortals and Eldras alike as gods, however, they are not actual gods but mere godlike beings.\n\nWhile Eldradas are technically of the same [[Existential Gradient]] as Eldrasils, they are simply the peak of power and unfathomably more mysterious.\n\n[[toc]]\n\n# Characteristics\nAn Eldrada is a cosmic entity usually the size of a galaxy's black hole. Their true bodies are abstract celestial objects, sometimes in the form of nebula clouds, planetary systems, black holes, and more. Within their bodies is their Divine Realm which is fitted based on the Eldrada's personality, will, and aspect.\n\nAnd Eldrada is a being most closest to Nature, each representing a certain Aspects. Eldrada\u2019s have their own will, but they are neither inherently good nor evil.\n\nEldrada\u2019s cannot help do anything but the sole fulfillment of their Aspect. Thus, the god of Molevolence will keep doing evil things and the god of kindness will keep spreading benevolence.\n\n# Mortality\nAn Eldrada is a cosmic entity usually the size of a galaxy's black hole.

Thus, the god of Molevolence will keep doing evil things and the god of kindness will keep spreading benevolence.\n\n# Aspects\nAn Eldrada can only have one aspect which they have \"Supreme\" control over and multiple other minor aspects. They can never have \"Absolute\" control over an aspect and neither do they want as doing so would mean becoming \"that\" aspect itself and losing their ego and essentially becoming a true part of Nature.\n\nAn Eldrda gains their power from their dominance over a specific aspect of nature and they are equal to none towards their Primary aspects, although with regards to secondary aspects, they can share it with other gods.\n\n# Weakness\n* An Eldrada can only be killed by Usurping their Dominance over an Aspect of nature or the lost of enough Logos. However, either are utterly unlikely, and chances of it happening is practically zero.\n* An Eldrada must continuously assert their Dominance over their Aspect. Although once established, there\u2019s hardly a chance for an Eldrada to die because no one else can ever usurp them.\n* An Eldrada has a chance of losing their ego if they control too much over a certain aspect of nature and end up, no longer representing that aspect but becoming that Aspect itself. In this case they lose their individuality and truly become part of nature, which every Eldrada fears.\nAn Eldrada requires Logos to continuously exists\n\n# Mantling\nIs a process where an Eldrada gives up their control over their aspect with full consent towards another entity, who, while initially maintains self-independence, eventually becomes the being that represents that aspects before, thus making the previous and new owner of the aspect no different from one another.\n\n# List of Known Eldrada\n* [[Aeolius]] - God of Wisdom, Logic, and Philosophy\n* [[Hoven]] - God of Life, Wind, and Nature.\n* [[Jorngell]] - God of Smithing, Artistry, and Hearthfire.\n* [[Halbert]] - God of Agriculture, Fertility, Endurance, and Wine.\n* [[Yngdall]] - God of Mercy, Light, and Natural Order.\n* [[Fyohr]] - God of Chaos, Change, Mischief, and Revolution.\n* [[Shane]] - Goddess of Justice, Law, Integrity, and Rightful Retribution.\n* [[Miquella]] - Goddess of Music, Warmth, Compassion, and Peace.\n* [[Emilia]] - Goddess of Love, Kindness, Beauty, and Romance.\n* [[Annahria]] - Goddess of Education, Speech, Commerce, and Mercantile.\n* [[Theresia]] - Goddess of Sea, Water, Healing, and Flow.\n* [[Dianna]] - Goddess of Death, Burials, Rituals, and Silent Solitude.\n* [[Parthinus]]\n* [[Theranos]] - God of the Underworld, Dreamriver, and Silence.\n* [[Pavlos]]\n* [[Morten]]\n* [[Arbita]]\n* [[Khione]] - Goddess of Snow, Healing, and Beauty\n* [[Eragon]]- God of Earth, Endurance, and Trees\n* [[Oyesi]] - Goddess of Fire, Change and Temperance\n* [[Yngell]] - God of Water, War, and Ritual Combat.\n* [[Vulcan]]- God of Strength, Hardship, and Courage\n* [[Mephismer]] - God of Forbidden Knowledge, Libraries, and Horrors"}}}}
