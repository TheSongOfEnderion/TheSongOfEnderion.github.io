She is a very intelligent woman but has a rather meek and mild personality.

She's a very talented combatant and tactician, a talent which Ethan inherited from her.\n\nBut her fight for Justice in [[Desteria]] led to the death of her family, causing Lynnaria to go on a one-person journey to assassinate each and every perpetrator involved. But a day came when she was almost killed. Nearing death, she met [[Akatosh]] who realized she was an [[Ash Bringer]]. Realizing she was what he needed, he made a deal with her and in exchange, gave her the [[Torch of Sunder]] which greatly transformed Lynnaria's potential into that of a chosen one. She would then rapidly grew stronger and eventually set Desteria itself on fire, destroying its government and practically all of the cartel. Lynnaria travelled to other countries during this time to destroy every members of the [[Orcus Cult]] which was indirectly responsible for the death of her family.\n\nUpon returning to [[Desteria]] to finish some people off, she reunited with her boyfriend, [[Nathan]] who, in a bid of love for her and for his country  (fearing that Lynnaria would utterly destroy it), impregnated her with Ethan.
