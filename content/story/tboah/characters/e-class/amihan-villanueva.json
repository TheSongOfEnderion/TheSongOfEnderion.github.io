She is a cute girl with blonde hair and green eyes. One of the more quiet and well behaved student of E-Class, Amihan is your typical normal girl.\n\n[[toc]]\n\n# Appearance\nShe is a cute girl who dresses humbly and often times her hair in a bun with a hair pin she bought online. Amihan often sports a wry smile as a reaction to the crazy things happening around her.\n\n Although introverted and can be quite shy, but she is not timid and hides a valiant outlook underneath the kind surface.\n\n# Personality\nAmihan is a very quiet girl who has issues with stage fright. She likes to just smile and let things pass. She often wears a wry smile.\n\n## Insanity\nAmihan can become quite obsessed with whomever she finds affection for. She is a complete Yandere.\n\n# History\nAmihan was born with a recessive psion, a psion which her ancestor once had but were hidden within her genes. As a result, neither her parents knew how to help with her seemingly useless ability. It wasn't until Ethan noticed how her hands came out unscathed by a flying dagger that he noticed something wrong.\n\nIn truth, Amihan can turn her skin into a carbon metamaterial allowing that part to turn invisible. Initially, she thought her powers is invisibility and she thought it was useless since she initially can only turn her hands invisible. However, Ethan realized her true power is not invisibility but Metamaterial Carbon arrangement, essentially giving her a diamond skin. Together with the help of another friend, he trapped her into a Virtual Reality, fooling her that it was real. He trapped her in a cage with virtual monsters hounding her. The monsters will keep attacking her because they are seeing her. If she does not turn completely invisible, she will be eaten. Of course this is false but because she's not aware, she forced herself to do it until she actually succeeded.\n\n# Abilities\n- **Metamaterial Skin** - The ability to turn her skin into a super strong carbon metamaterial which deflect practically any damage to it. It's side effect is that it can also deflect light, turning her invisible."}}, "preview": {"profile": {"Title": "Amihan Villanueva", "Image": {"Original Art": "assets/images/e-class/amihan/amihan-original-art.png"}, "Content": {"Desc": {"Full Name": "Amihan Villanueva", "Alias": ["Invisible Hands", "2nd Most Useless ability"]}, "Biography": {"Race": "Human", "Birthday": "5 July", "Age": "15", "Gender": "Female", "Height": "154 cm", "Weight": "47 kg", "Eye Color": "Light Green", "Hair Color": "Light Blonde", "Skin Color": "Ligh", "Blood Type": "B-"}, "Power": {"Rank": "1st Awakener", "Active": ["Invicible Hands"]}, "Status": {"Status": ["Alive"], "Birthplace": "Country, Town", "Family": ["Tiana Villanueva (Mother)", "John Villanueva (Father)"]}}}, "tabs": {"default": "Amihan is one of the central characters of [[tboah]] and a member of [[e-class]].
