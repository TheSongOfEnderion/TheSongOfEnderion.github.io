She can be quite shy, but she is not timid and hides a valiant outlook underneath the kind surface.\n\n# Insanity\nAmihan can become quite obsessed with whomever she finds affection for. She is a complete Yandere.\n\n Metamaterial Skin. Amihan can turn her skin into a carbon metamaterial allowing that part to turn invisible. Initially, she thought her powers is invisibility and she thought it was useless since she initially can only turn her hands invisible. However, Ethan realized her true power is not invisibility but Metamaterial Carbon arrangement, essentially giving her a diamond skin. Together with the help of another friend, he trapped her into a Virtual Reality, fooling her that it was real. He trapped her in a cage with virtual monsters hounding her. The monsters will keep attacking her because they are seeing her. If she does not turn completely invisible, she will be eaten. Of course this is false but because she's not aware, she forced herself to do it until she actually succeeded."}}}, "tags": "", "parent": "tboah-characters"}
