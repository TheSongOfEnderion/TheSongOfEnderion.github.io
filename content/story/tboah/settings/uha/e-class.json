Its surrounding by a dense forest area with a wide track and field on its own right in front.\n\n# History\nWhen the [[ElucidKing]] first founded [[UHA]] Academy, he noticed that it somehow attracts a percentage of the most terrible students from all over the world. These students were complete sociopaths, without any care for safety but only the adherence of their pleasures and desires. Not only that, each of them has the potential to become a danger to the entire world. The [[ElucidKing]], however, saw the potential within these young students, hence [[E-Class]] was born to isolate them so they will not do harm to the rest of the Student body.\n\nWithin the mountain, the Academy can focus on rehabilitating these students to they can become healthy members of society. While the program succeeded in turning most students into proper, Empathic adults, some were beyond hope and became a menace to the entire world. Although the number were few, it was enough to label E-Class as the \"Breeding Ground of Demon Lords\" to those in the know-how.\n\nFor years to come, the [[ElucidKing]] went on to hide the existence of E-Class, so much that he classified it as a [[Level Zero Holy Ground]], a title that means not even an [[Eldrada]] can enter the sanctuary. Each members of E-Class were secretly given honorary [[Avalon]] citizenship, the Divine City on Earth. This means no international organization can do them any harm, as doing so will invoke Article 3 of the [[Avalon Charter Pact]] which will allow [[Shadow Garden]] to \"Completely Annihilate\" any aggressor entities regardless of affiliation.\n\nIn the present day, due to the absence of Mana, whose presence gives great insight to the mind and thus creates people with a high degree of fanaticism, e-class now remained mostly unused, with a few students gaining entry once in a few years. However, these students, given some guidance came out relatively benign.\n\nUntil [[2285]] when the class was suddenly filled with 18 Students.\n\n# Teachers\nThe current teachers of E-Class are the following\n* [[Agatha]]\n* [[Martin]]\n* [[Gibbins]]\n* [[Melisia]]\n\n# Members\nThe current members of E-class:\n[[Ethan Morales]] [[Jay Baker]] [[Romel Campbell]] [[Isko Devera]] [[Reginald Guillory]] [[Klein Huber]] [[Efren Morris]] [[Ranko Castellano]] [[Benjamin Sanchez]] [[Grant Wilson]]\n\n[[Eltia Axolin]] [[Niña Bach]] [[Giselle Iridao]] [[Leticia Lewinne]] [[Yasha Romanova]] [[Maurish Serrano]] [[Mayumi Severino]] [[Amihan Villanueva]]\n\n# Student Abilities\n## Boys\n* [[Ethan Morales]] - Candlefire/creation\n* [[Jay Baker]] - Superstrength\n* [[Romel Campbell]] - Sticky Hands\n* [[Isko Devera]] - 10 Grain Sand\n* [[Reginald Guillory]]\n* [[Klein Huber]] - Bandage Arms\n* [[Efren Morris]] \n* [[Ranko Castellano]] - Dragon Physiology\n* [[Benjamin Sanchez]] - Bone Manipulation/Healing Factor\n* [[Grant Wilson]] - Voice Power\n\n## Girls\n* [[Eltia Axolin]] - Axolotl Physiology\n* [[Niña Bach]] - Shield Generation\n* [[Giselle Iridao]] - Ice Flower\n* [[Leticia Lewinne]] - Chaos\n* [[Yasha Romanova]] - Flaw Fracture\n* [[Maurish Serrano]] - Lightning Deer\n* [[Mayumi Severino]] - Animal Mimicry\n* [[Amihan Villanueva]] - Metamaterial Skin\n\n\n"}}, "preview": {"tabs": {"default": "E-Class is the last class within [[UHA]] and is isolated on top of a mountain.\n\n[[toc]]\n\n# Location\nThe Class is located on top of a mountain, north-east of the school grounds.
