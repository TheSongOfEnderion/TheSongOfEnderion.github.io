# History
When the [[ElucidKing]] first founded [[UHA]] Academy, he noticed that it somehow attracts a percentage of the most terrible students from all over the world. These students were complete sociopaths, without any care for safety but only the adherence of their pleasures and desires. The [[ElucidKing]], however, saw the potential within these young students, hence [[E-Class]] was born to isolate them so they will not do harm to the rest of the Student body.

Within the mountain, the Academy can focus on rehabilitating these students to they can become healthy members of society. While the program succeeded in turning most students into proper, Empathic adults, some were beyond hope and became a menace to the entire world. Although the number were few, it was enough to label E-Class as the "Breeding Ground of Demon Lords" to those in the know-how.

For years to come, the [[ElucidKing]] went on to hide the existence of E-Class, so much that he classified it as a [[Level Zero Holy Ground]], a title that means not even an [[Eldrada]] can enter the sanctuary. Each members of E-Class were secretly given honorary [[Avalon]] citizenship, the Divine City on Earth. This means no international organization can do them any harm, as doing so will invoke Article 3 of the [[Avalon Charter Pact]] which will allow [[Shadow Garden]] to "Completely Annihilate" any aggressor entities regardless of affiliation.
